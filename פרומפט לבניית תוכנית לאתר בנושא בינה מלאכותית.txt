You will help create a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) for building a website. This process has two phases: first you'll ask clarifying questions, then you'll create detailed documentation.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: You must write all of your responses in Hebrew (עברית). This includes all analysis, questions, and final deliverables.**

Here is the website topic you'll be working with:

<topic>
{{TOPIC}}
</topic>

Here are any additional requirements that have been specified:

<additional_requirements>
{{ADDITIONAL_REQUIREMENTS}}
</additional_requirements>

## Overview of the Two-Phase Process

**Phase 1 (Information Gathering)**: You will analyze the provided information, identify gaps, and ask 5-10 strategic clarifying questions in Hebrew.

**Phase 2 (Document Creation)**: After receiving answers to your questions, you will create two deliverables in Hebrew:
1. A comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD)
2. A task tracking file (TASKS.MD) with actionable items

## Phase 1: Asking Clarifying Questions

You are currently in Phase 1. Your task is to generate questions that will help you create a complete PRD.

Before presenting your questions, work through your thinking process as follows:

**Step 1: Language Check**
In <language_check> tags, confirm that you understand you must write in Hebrew and briefly note how you will ensure all your output (analysis, questions, and later deliverables) will be in Hebrew.

**Step 2: Analysis**
In <analysis> tags (written in Hebrew), work through the following:

1. **Extract all provided information**: First, systematically go through the topic and additional requirements and list out every piece of information provided. Be explicit and comprehensive - write down each detail, requirement, or constraint mentioned.

2. **What is already clear**: Based on your extraction, summarize the specific information provided. Be explicit about what you know.

3. **What is missing**: List the critical information gaps that you need to fill. This section can be extensive.

4. **Category-by-category assessment**: For each of these categories, note what's known and what needs clarification:
   - Target audience and user needs
   - Core features and functionality priorities  
   - Technical constraints or preferences
   - Timeline and resource constraints
   - Success criteria and business goals
   - Content strategy and requirements
   - Design preferences or brand guidelines

**Step 3: Draft and Verify Questions**
In <questions_draft> tags (written in Hebrew):
- Draft 5-10 clarifying questions grouped by category
- For each question, verify that the answer isn't already provided in the topic or additional requirements
- If a question is already answered, note this and revise or remove it

**Step 4: Present Final Questions**
In <questions> tags (written in Hebrew), present your final 5-10 well-organized clarifying questions. Group related questions together under clear category headings. Make each question specific and actionable.

Use this structure:
```
<questions>
**[Category Name in Hebrew]:**
1. [Question in Hebrew]
2. [Question in Hebrew]

**[Another Category Name in Hebrew]:**
3. [Question in Hebrew]
4. [Question in Hebrew]
</questions>
```

## Phase 2: Creating the PRD and Task File

Once you receive answers to your questions, you will enter Phase 2. At that point, follow these steps:

**Step 1: Planning**
In <prd_planning> tags (written in Hebrew), work through the following:

1. **Gather information from each source**: Systematically go through each information source and list what it provides:
   - Information from the original topic
   - Information from the additional requirements
   - Information from the user's answers to your questions

2. **Compile all information**: Create a comprehensive master list of everything gathered. Quote or paraphrase key details.

3. **Categorize the information**: Organize by audience, features, technical specs, timeline, etc.

4. **Prioritize**: Identify which items are must-haves versus nice-to-haves based on signals in the information.

5. **Map to PRD sections**: List the key sections that should appear in the PRD and note which gathered information belongs in each section.

6. **Break down into tasks**: List every task you can think of for building this website. Be thorough and comprehensive.

7. **Organize tasks**: Group tasks by phase or category, ensuring a logical flow from planning through launch.

It's OK for this planning section to be quite long - thoroughness is important.

**Step 2: Create the PRD**
In <prd> tags (written in Hebrew), create a comprehensive Product Requirements Document with these sections:

- **סקירה כללית של הפרויקט** (Project Overview): Purpose, goals, and target audience
- **סיפורי משתמשים** (User Stories): Key user personas and their needs
- **דרישות פונקציונליות** (Functional Requirements): Detailed feature specifications organized by priority
- **דרישות תוכן** (Content Requirements): Content structure, types, and organization
- **דרישות עיצוב** (Design Requirements): Visual design approach, UX principles, branding
- **דרישות טכניות** (Technical Requirements): Platform, hosting, integrations, performance requirements
- **מדדי הצלחה** (Success Metrics): KPIs and measurement criteria
- **ציר זמן ואבני דרך** (Timeline & Milestones): Phased development approach with key dates
- **אילוצים והנחות** (Constraints & Assumptions): Any limitations or dependencies

**Step 3: Create the Task Tracking File**
In <tasks> tags (written in Hebrew), create a task list using markdown checkbox format. Organize tasks into logical phases with clear, actionable items. It's OK for this section to be quite long.

Use this structure:
```
<tasks>
# [Title in Hebrew]

## [Phase Name in Hebrew]
- [ ] [Task description in Hebrew]
- [ ] [Task description in Hebrew]
- [ ] [Task description in Hebrew]

## [Another Phase Name in Hebrew]
- [ ] [Task description in Hebrew]
- [ ] [Task description in Hebrew]
</tasks>
```

Example phase categories you might use:
- תכנון ועיצוב (Planning & Design)
- הקמת סביבת פיתוח (Development Setup)
- פיתוח ליבה (Core Development)
- תוכן ובדיקות (Content & Testing)
- השקה (Launch)

**You are currently in Phase 1.** Begin by checking the language requirement, then analyze what information you need, and finally present your clarifying questions in Hebrew.
